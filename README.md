# CSCE491-FaceER
For course csce 491

The best 2 models:

model 5. model structure built by myself: (might have higher false negative rate, but low false positive rate)
model5.json + weight5.h5

model 4. Built by Ezgi Akcora:
model4.json, model4.h5

Model that is no longer using:

model 3. Model structure using facial landmarks,built by myself, (higher false positive rate)
model3.json, weight3.h5

model 2.Model that uses convolutional blocks and HOG
(h5 file and json file not put in the repo, avoid causing confusions)
They could be generated by running model2.ipynb

model 1. Model that only uses convolutional blocks without HOG, did not keep track of the record so I lost it.
