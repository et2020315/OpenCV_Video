# CSCE491-FaceER
For course csce 491

The best 2 models:
1. model structure built by myself: (might have higher false negative rate, but low false positive rate)
mstruc.json + mweights.h5
2. Built by Ezgi Akcora:
model.json, weights.h5

Model that is no longer using:

3. Model structure using facial landmarks,built by myself, (higher false positive rate)
mstru-14.json, mweights-14.h5

4.Model that uses convolutional blocks and HOG
(h5 file and json file not put in the repo, avoid causing confusions)
They could be generated by running model2.ipynb
